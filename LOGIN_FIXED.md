# âœ… Login Issue Fixed

## Problem
- User `pat@murphyconsulting.us` existed in database but had no password field
- Login attempts were failing with "Invalid credentials" error

## Solution
1. **Identified the issue**: User had missing password field in MongoDB
2. **Fixed password**: Used the User model's pre-save hook to properly hash and store the password
3. **Verified functionality**: Tested both database authentication and API login

## Current Status
- âœ… User exists: `pat@murphyconsulting.us`
- âœ… Password set and working: `B5tccpbx`
- âœ… User has admin privileges
- âœ… Backend API login working
- âœ… JWT token generation working

## How to Login
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000/sign-in
- **Email**: pat@murphyconsulting.us
- **Password**: B5tccpbx

## Next Steps
The login should now work properly in the frontend. You can:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/sign-in
2. Enter the credentials above
3. You should be redirected to the admin dashboard
4. Access all admin features including the settings panel

## Test Results
```
âœ… Login API successful!
