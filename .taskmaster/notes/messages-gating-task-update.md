# Taskmaster Task Update - Messages Gating Fix

## Task Status Update
- **Project**: linkage-va-hub
- **Task**: Messages page gating
- **New Status**: In Progress → Completed
- **Completion Date**: 2025-01-09

## Issue Summary
**Bug**: Messages page was showing 2 default seeded conversations to users with incomplete profiles (<= 80% completion)

**Expected**: Messages page should be fully gated (no conversations visible) until profile completion exceeds 80%

## Implementation Details

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Server-side gating on all conversation/message endpoints
2. ✅ Client-side gating UI with onboarding notice
3. ✅ Strict threshold enforcement (> 80%, not >= 80%)
4. ✅ Metadata leakage prevention (unread counts, conversation IDs)
5. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (backend + frontend)

### Gating Applied To:
- GET /api/conversations (conversation list)
- GET /api/conversations/:id (conversation detail)
- GET /api/conversations/unread/count (unread counts)
- GET /api/messages/:conversationId (message data)
- PUT /api/messages/:id/read (mark as read)
- POST /api/conversations/start/:vaId (already had gating)

### Who Is Gated:
- Business users with profile completion ≤ 80.0%
- Users with missing/undefined profile data (treated as 0%)

### Who Bypasses Gating:
- VA users (always have messaging access)
- Admin users (full access to all conversations)
- Business users with profile completion > 80.0%

## Technical Changes

### Backend Files Modified:
1. `backend/routes/conversations.js` - Added gating checks to list and detail endpoints
2. `backend/routes/messages.js` - Added gating to message access endpoints
3. `backend/middleware/profileCompletion.js` - Fixed threshold to use strictly > comparison

### Frontend Files Modified:
1. `frontend/src/pages/Conversations/index.js` - Gated UI with onboarding notice
2. `frontend/src/pages/Conversations/Detail.js` - Redirect to gated view on 403

### Test Files Created:
1. `backend/tests/conversationGating.test.js` - Backend gating logic tests
2. `frontend/src/pages/Conversations/__tests__/Conversations.gating.test.js` - Frontend UI tests

### Documentation Created:
1. `MESSAGES_GATING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive implementation guide

## Testing Verification

### Test Cases Covered:
- [x] 0% completion - fully gated
- [x] 79% completion - gated
- [x] Exactly 80.0% completion - gated (boundary test)
- [x] 80.01%+ completion - unlocked
- [x] VA user bypass
- [x] Admin user bypass
- [x] Metadata leakage prevention
- [x] Deep link handling (direct /conversations/:id access)
- [x] Unread count suppression when gated

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deploy Checklist:
- [x] Code changes completed
- [x] Tests written
- [ ] Tests passing in CI/CD
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Staging environment tested

### Post-Deploy Verification:
1. Test with business account at 0% completion
2. Test with business account at exactly 80% completion
3. Test with business account at 85% completion
4. Verify VA users can still access messages
5. Verify admin users can access all conversations
6. Check analytics for gated view events

### Monitoring Points:
- Watch for 403 PROFILE_INCOMPLETE errors in logs
- Monitor conversion rate from gated → unlocked
- Track time-to-80% completion metric

## Commit & PR Info

**Branch**: fix/messages-gating
**Commit Message**: See MESSAGES_GATING_IMPLEMENTATION.md for full message

**PR Title**: Fix: Implement profile completion gating for Messages page (> 80%)

**PR Description**:
Fixes the bug where users with incomplete profiles were seeing default/seeded messages on the Messages page.

**Changes**:
- Adds server-side gating to all conversation and message endpoints
- Implements client-side onboarding notice UI for gated users
- Enforces strict > 80% threshold (users at exactly 80% remain gated)
- Prevents metadata leakage through unread counts and IDs
- Adds comprehensive test coverage

**Testing**:
- Backend tests verify gating at 0%, 80%, and > 80% completion levels
- Frontend tests verify UI renders correctly for gated and unlocked states
- Manual testing completed on local environment

**Security**:
- No conversation data exposed to gated users
- Consistent PROFILE_INCOMPLETE error code
- VA users and admins appropriately bypass gating

## Next Steps for Taskmaster
1. Update task status to "Done" or "Completed"
2. Add note: "Fixed gating bug - users with ≤80% profile completion now see onboarding notice instead of default messages"
3. Link to commit: [Will be added after commit]
4. Close related GitHub issue if applicable
