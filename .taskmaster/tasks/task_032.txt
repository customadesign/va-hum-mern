## 1. Set up Clerk SDK and Create Auth Provider Wrapper [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize Clerk SDK and create a wrapper component that manages both Clerk and JWT authentication methods
### Details:
Install @clerk/clerk-react and required dependencies. Create AuthProvider.tsx that implements Clerk's ClerkProvider and includes JWT context. Set up authentication state management using React Context. Configure environment variables for Clerk API keys. Implement basic session management functions.
<info added on 2025-08-07T17:44:21.314Z>
Update API service authentication to use Clerk session tokens instead of localStorage JWT tokens. Ensure all API requests include the Clerk session token in the Authorization header. Maintain JWT token handling as fallback mechanism in hybrid authentication flow. Update environment configuration with production Clerk publishable key (pk_live_*) and secret key (sk_live_*) values.

## 2. Implement Authentication Middleware Chain [done]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Create middleware system that prioritizes Clerk authentication with JWT fallback
### Details:
Create middleware/auth.ts to handle authentication chain. Implement Clerk session verification as primary auth method. Add JWT verification as fallback. Create user session mapping between Clerk and JWT identities. Set up error handling and logging for auth failures. Implement middleware registration in API routes.
<info added on 2025-08-07T19:07:02.016Z>
Implementation verification completed. Authentication middleware chain is fully operational with the following components:

- hybridAuth.js: Primary middleware implementing intelligent routing between Clerk and JWT authentication
- clerkAuth.js: Clerk authentication with JWT fallback via legacyProtect function
- auth.js: Legacy JWT middleware maintained for backward compatibility

All API routes (users.js, businesses.js, vas.js) successfully integrated with hybridAuth middleware. Authentication chain provides:
- Primary Clerk authentication using session tokens
- Automatic JWT fallback for existing users
- Seamless user migration path from JWT to Clerk with email-based account linking
- Comprehensive role-based authorization (admin, va, business roles)
- Optional authentication support for public endpoints
- Structured user onboarding flow for new Clerk registrations

Production deployment completed with full implementation across API routes. System maintains E-Systems mode compatibility while enabling gradual migration to Clerk-primary authentication.

Testing verified proper error handling, user suspension checks, and successful authentication flows in all scenarios. Implementation meets security requirements and maintains backward compatibility.
