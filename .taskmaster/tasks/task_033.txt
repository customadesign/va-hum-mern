# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement DISC Assessment Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 28, 22, 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate external DISC API to create a comprehensive personality assessment system for VAs, including assessment delivery, result storage, and personality-business matching algorithms.
# Details:
Implementation steps and considerations:

1. External DISC API Integration:
- Set up API authentication and credentials management
- Implement API client wrapper class for DISC service
- Create rate limiting and error handling middleware
- Configure webhook endpoints for assessment completion

2. Assessment Form Development:
- Build dynamic form components for DISC questionnaire
- Implement progress saving functionality
- Add form validation and error handling
- Create mobile-responsive design
- Include timeout handling for long sessions

3. Result Storage System:
- Design MongoDB schema for DISC assessment results
- Implement secure storage of assessment data
- Create data encryption for sensitive information
- Build result caching mechanism
- Set up automated cleanup for incomplete assessments

4. Personality Matching Algorithm:
- Develop scoring system for DISC profiles
- Create business-VA compatibility matrix
- Implement weighted matching algorithm
- Build personality type categorization
- Add confidence scoring for matches

5. Integration with Existing Systems:
- Connect with VA profile system
- Integrate with Smart Matching Algorithm
- Add assessment status to profile completion gate
- Implement real-time updates via WebSocket
- Create admin dashboard for assessment monitoring

Technical Considerations:
- Implement proper error handling for API downtime
- Ensure GDPR compliance for personality data
- Add rate limiting for assessment submissions
- Include audit logging for assessment activities
- Implement caching for frequently accessed results

# Test Strategy:
1. API Integration Testing:
- Verify successful API authentication
- Test rate limiting functionality
- Validate error handling scenarios
- Check webhook processing
- Test API timeout handling

2. Assessment Form Testing:
- Validate all form fields and interactions
- Test progress saving functionality
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Check timeout handling
- Test form validation rules

3. Data Storage Testing:
- Verify secure storage of assessment data
- Test encryption/decryption functionality
- Validate data schema compliance
- Check cleanup procedures
- Test concurrent access handling

4. Algorithm Testing:
- Validate matching algorithm accuracy
- Test compatibility scoring
- Verify personality categorization
- Check confidence score calculation
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

5. Integration Testing:
- Verify VA profile integration
- Test matching system integration
- Validate completion gate functionality
- Check WebSocket updates
- Test admin dashboard features

6. Performance Testing:
- Load testing for concurrent assessments
- Response time measurements
- Database query optimization
- Cache hit ratio analysis
- API latency monitoring
