# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Business Profile Completion Gate
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a profile completion gate system requiring businesses to have 80% profile completion before contacting VAs
# Details:
Create completion calculation logic using MongoDB aggregation:
- Required fields: company info, contact details, business verification

- Socket.io 4.6.2 for real-time updates
- React 18.2.0 with Tailwind CSS 3.3.6
- React Query 3.39.3 for state management

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for completion calculation
API endpoint testing with Jest
UI component testing with React Testing Library
End-to-end testing with Cypress
Real-time update verification
