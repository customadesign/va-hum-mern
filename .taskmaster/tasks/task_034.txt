- Test app launch and splash screen display

3. Performance Testing:
- Measure and validate loading times on mobile networks
- Test performance under varying network conditions
- Verify lazy loading functionality
- Monitor memory usage on mobile devices
- Validate offline data synchronization

4. Cross-browser Testing:
- Test on major mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Verify functionality on iOS and Android devices
- Test PWA installation on different platforms
- Validate touch events across browsers

5. Integration Testing:
- Verify chat functionality on mobile devices
- Test file upload/download on mobile
- Validate authentication flows on mobile
- Check third-party integrations in mobile context
