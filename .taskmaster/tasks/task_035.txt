# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Advanced Search and Filtering System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 30, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive search functionality with multi-criteria filtering for VAs and businesses, including skills, location, availability, rate range, experience level, ratings, and keyword search with optimized performance.
# Details:
Implementation steps and considerations:

1. Search Infrastructure Setup:
- Implement Elasticsearch or similar search engine integration
- Create search index optimization for VA profiles
- Set up field mappings for all filterable attributes
- Configure text analysis for keyword search
- Implement caching layer for frequent searches

2. Filter Component Development:
- Create reusable filter components for each criteria:
  * Skills multi-select with autocomplete
  * Location search with radius options
  * Availability calendar integration
  * Rate range slider
  * Experience level dropdown
  * Rating filter with star visualization
- Implement dynamic query builder
- Add filter combination logic
- Create filter state management

3. Search Results Optimization:
- Implement pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Add result sorting options (relevance, rating, rate)
- Create result caching mechanism
- Implement lazy loading for results
- Add result highlighting for matched terms

4. Performance Considerations:
- Implement debouncing for search inputs
- Add request throttling
- Create search result caching
- Optimize query execution plans
- Implement parallel query processing where applicable

5. Security Implementation:
- Add input sanitization
- Implement rate limiting for search API
- Add authentication checks for sensitive filters
- Create audit logging for search patterns

# Test Strategy:
1. Functionality Testing:
- Verify all filter combinations work correctly
- Test keyword search accuracy
- Validate sorting functionality
- Check pagination behavior
- Test filter reset and clear functions

2. Performance Testing:
- Measure search response times under various loads
- Verify cache hit rates
- Test system with large result sets
- Validate memory usage under heavy load
- Check query optimization effectiveness

3. Integration Testing:
- Verify filter interaction with matching algorithm
- Test search integration with profile system
- Validate security middleware functionality
- Check rate limiting behavior

4. UI/UX Testing:
- Verify filter responsiveness
- Test mobile compatibility
- Validate error handling and messages
- Check loading state indicators
- Test accessibility compliance

5. Load Testing:
- Perform concurrent search testing
- Validate system behavior under peak loads
- Test cache performance
- Measure resource utilization

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Elasticsearch Infrastructure and Index Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize Elasticsearch, create and optimize search indices for VA profiles, and configure field mappings for all filterable attributes
### Details:
Install and configure Elasticsearch, create index mappings for VA profiles including fields for skills, location, availability, rates, experience, and ratings. Set up text analysis for keyword search with proper tokenization and filtering. Configure index settings for optimal performance including refresh intervals and shard configuration.

## 2. Implement Core Filter Components and Query Builder [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Develop reusable filter components for each search criteria and create dynamic query builder system
### Details:
Create React components for skills multi-select with autocomplete, location search with radius selection, availability calendar, rate range slider, experience level dropdown, and rating filter. Implement state management using React Context or Redux. Build query builder service to convert filter states into Elasticsearch queries.

## 3. Develop Search Results Management and Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1, 35.2
### Description: Implement search results handling including pagination, sorting, caching, and result highlighting
### Details:
Implement cursor-based pagination system, add sorting options for relevance/rating/rate, create Redis caching layer for search results, implement lazy loading with IntersectionObserver, add result highlighting for matched terms. Include debouncing for search inputs and request throttling.

## 4. Implement Security Measures and Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2, 35.3
### Description: Add security features including input sanitization, rate limiting, and audit logging
### Details:
Implement input sanitization for all search parameters, set up rate limiting using Redis, add authentication checks for sensitive filters, create audit logging system for search patterns. Configure request throttling with proper error handling and user feedback.

## 5. Optimize Search Performance and Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.3, 35.4
### Description: Fine-tune search performance and integrate with existing VA profile system
### Details:
Optimize Elasticsearch query execution plans, implement parallel query processing where applicable, integrate with VA profile system, add real-time index updates for profile changes, implement search analytics tracking. Fine-tune caching strategies based on usage patterns.
