# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization and Caching System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31, 32, 35
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive performance optimization including Redis caching, database indexing, CDN integration, and code splitting to enhance platform speed and scalability.
# Details:
Implementation steps and considerations:

1. Redis Caching Setup:
- Install and configure Redis server
- Implement Redis client configuration with fallback handling
- Create caching middleware for API responses
- Define cache invalidation strategies
- Set up cache warming mechanisms
- Implement distributed caching patterns

2. Database Optimization:
- Analyze and create optimal indexes based on query patterns
- Implement query optimization using EXPLAIN analysis
- Set up database connection pooling
- Configure query result caching
- Implement database-level partitioning strategies

3. CDN Integration:
- Configure CDN provider (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront)
- Set up asset deployment pipeline to CDN
- Implement cache control headers
- Configure CDN routing and edge locations
- Set up SSL/TLS certificates for CDN endpoints

4. Frontend Optimization:
- Implement React code splitting using dynamic imports
- Set up lazy loading for images and components
- Configure webpack chunking optimization
- Implement service worker for asset caching
- Add progressive image loading
- Optimize bundle size using tree shaking

5. Performance Monitoring:
- Set up real-time performance metrics collection
- Implement frontend performance tracking (Core Web Vitals)
- Create performance dashboards
- Configure alerting for performance degradation
- Implement synthetic monitoring for key user flows

6. Additional Optimizations:
- Enable HTTP/2 and compression
- Implement API response compression
- Set up browser caching policies
- Configure prefetching for critical resources
- Implement rate limiting and request queuing

# Test Strategy:
1. Cache Testing:
- Verify Redis cache hit/miss rates
- Test cache invalidation scenarios
- Validate cache consistency across distributed system
- Measure cache response times
- Test cache failure recovery

2. Database Performance Testing:
- Validate query execution plans
- Measure query response times before/after optimization
- Test index effectiveness
- Verify connection pool efficiency
- Load test with concurrent queries

3. CDN Testing:
- Verify asset delivery from edge locations
- Test CDN failover scenarios
- Validate SSL/TLS configuration
- Measure asset loading times from different regions
- Test cache purge functionality

4. Frontend Performance Testing:
- Measure Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Test code splitting effectiveness
- Validate lazy loading behavior
- Measure bundle load times
- Test offline functionality
- Verify Core Web Vitals metrics

5. Load Testing:
- Conduct stress tests under various loads
- Measure system scalability
- Test performance under concurrent users
- Validate rate limiting behavior
- Monitor resource utilization

6. Integration Testing:
- End-to-end performance testing
- Cross-browser performance validation
- Mobile device performance testing
- API response time testing
- Real-user monitoring validation
