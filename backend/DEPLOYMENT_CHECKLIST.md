# Video Course Feature Deployment Checklist

## Environment Variables for Render

The following environment variables need to be added to the Render deployment:

### VideoSDK Configuration
```
VIDEOSDK_API_KEY=56566ba5-1557-4699-8fd2-ba7edfe6ad0d
VIDEOSDK_SECRET_KEY=ddfbfc0007d1b5bb4765adf200733ace3dd05318b99c1d5f1622945ddf3b5e10
BACKEND_URL=https://linkage-va-hub.onrender.com
```

### Existing Environment Variables (ensure these are set)
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT secret key
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - SendGrid API key
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` - SendGrid from email
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Frontend URL
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Node environment
- `PORT` - Server port (usually auto-set by Render)

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Add Environment Variables in Render Dashboard**
   - Go to your Render service dashboard
   - Navigate to Environment â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add the VideoSDK variables listed above
   - Save changes (this will trigger a redeploy)

2. **Run Seed Script**
   After deployment is complete, run the seed script to populate demo courses:
   ```bash
   npm run seed:courses
   ```
   
   This can be done via:
   - Render Shell (if available)
   - Or by creating a one-time job in Render
   - Or by running locally with production MongoDB URI

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check `/api/courses` endpoint returns courses
   - Test VideoSDK integration at `/api/courses/videosdk/token`
   - Verify course enrollment works
