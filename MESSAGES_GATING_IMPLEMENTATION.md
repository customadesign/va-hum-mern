# Messages Page Profile Completion Gating

## Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-09  
**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Threshold**: Profile completion must be **strictly greater than 80%** (> 80.0%, not >= 80.0%)

## Problem Statement

Users with incomplete profiles on https://linkage-va-hub.onrender.com/conversations were incorrectly seeing default/seeded messages. The expected behavior is to gate all messaging functionality until profile completion exceeds 80%.

## Solution Overview

Implemented comprehensive gating for the Messages page with both server-side and client-side enforcement:

### Server-Side Gating (Backend)
- **File**: `backend/routes/conversations.js`
- **File**: `backend/routes/messages.js`
- **File**: `backend/middleware/profileCompletion.js`

#### Endpoints Protected:
1. `GET /api/conversations` - List all conversations
2. `GET /api/conversations/:id` - View specific conversation
3. `GET /api/conversations/unread/count` - Unread message counts
4. `POST /api/conversations/start/:vaId` - Start new conversation (already protected)
5. `GET /api/messages/:conversationId` - Get messages for a conversation
6. `PUT /api/messages/:id/read` - Mark messages as read

#### Gating Logic:
- Business users (non-VA, non-admin) have profile completion checked
- If `Business.completionPercentage <= 80`, return 403 with:
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "gated": true,
    "error": "PROFILE_INCOMPLETE",
    "message": "Welcome to your messages. To get started, visit your Dashboard to complete your profile and begin conversations.",
    "profileCompletion": <percentage>,
    "requiredCompletion": 80
  }
  ```
- VA users and admins bypass gating
- Missing or undefined profile completion treated as 0%

### Client-Side Gating (Frontend)
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/Conversations/index.js`
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/Conversations/Detail.js`

#### UI Behavior When Gated (≤ 80%):
- Shows onboarding notice: "Welcome to your messages. To get started, visit your Dashboard to complete your profile and begin conversations."
- Displays current profile completion percentage
- Shows visual progress bar
- Includes prominent "Complete Your Profile" CTA linking to `/dashboard`
- Hides ALL messaging UI:
  - Conversations list
  - Message threads
  - Message composer
  - Unread count badges
  - Default/seeded messages

#### UI Behavior When Unlocked (> 80%):
- Shows full conversations list
- Displays default/seeded messages
- Enables composer and all messaging interactions
- Shows unread count badges
- Normal pagination and real-time updates

### Threshold Details
- **Strict threshold**: > 80.0% (not >= 80.0%)
- Users at exactly 80.0% remain gated
- Users at 80.01% and above are unlocked
- Missing/undefined completion = 0% (gated)

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. **backend/routes/conversations.js**
   - Added gating checks to GET `/` and GET `/:id` endpoints
   - Added gating to unread count endpoint to prevent metadata leakage
   - Imports `Business` model and `calculateCompletionPercentage` function

2. **backend/routes/messages.js**
   - Added gating to GET `/messages/:conversationId` endpoint
   - Added gating to PUT `/messages/:id/read` endpoint
   - Prevents access to message data when gated

3. **backend/middleware/profileCompletion.js**
   - Updated `profileCompletionGate` middleware to use strictly greater than (>) comparison
   - Changed error message to reflect "more than X%" requirement
   - Exported `calculateCompletionPercentage` for use in routes

### Frontend
1. **frontend/src/pages/Conversations/index.js**
   - Modified query to handle 403 gated responses
   - Added conditional rendering for gated state
   - Hides all conversations and sample messages when gated
   - Shows comprehensive onboarding notice with profile completion details
   - Added `ExclamationTriangleIcon` to imports

2. **frontend/src/pages/Conversations/Detail.js**
   - Added error handling for gated 403 responses
   - Redirects to `/conversations` list when conversation detail access is gated
   - Shows toast notification about profile completion requirement
   - Prevents retry on gating errors

### Tests
1. **backend/tests/conversationGating.test.js** (NEW)
   - Tests for 0%, exactly 80%, and > 80% completion levels
   - Tests for VA and admin bypass
   - Tests for metadata leakage prevention in unread counts
   - Tests for conversation starting, viewing, and message access

2. **frontend/src/pages/Conversations/__tests__/Conversations.gating.test.js** (NEW)
   - UI rendering tests for gated state
   - Tests for onboarding notice display
   - Tests for hiding messaging UI when gated
   - Tests for unlocked state rendering
   - Tests for VA user bypass

## QA Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New user with 0–79.99% completion
- ✅ Visiting /conversations shows only onboarding notice
- ✅ No default messages or threads visible
- ✅ Composer hidden/disabled
- ✅ Direct visit to /conversations/:id redirects without leaking thread info
- ✅ Unread counts return 0 without exposing actual data

### Scenario 2: User at exactly 80.00% completion
- ✅ Still gated (same behavior as Scenario 1)
- ✅ Onboarding notice shows 80% completion
- ✅ Progress bar reflects 80%

### Scenario 3: User at 80.01%+ completion
- ✅ Full access to /conversations
- ✅ Shows default messages and any new messages
- ✅ Composer enabled
- ✅ Thread view works
- ✅ Unread counts render correctly

### Scenario 4: VA Users
- ✅ Never gated regardless of profile completion
- ✅ Full messaging access at all times

### Scenario 5: Admin Users
- ✅ Never gated
- ✅ Can see all conversations including intercepted ones

### Regression Checks
- ✅ Notifications don't appear for gated users
- ✅ Unread badges don't show for gated users
- ✅ API responses don't reveal counts or IDs to gated users
- ✅ Dashboard link in gated notice navigates correctly
- ✅ Responsive design works for both gated and unlocked states

## Security Considerations

1. **Server-side enforcement**: All gating logic enforced on backend
2. **No data leakage**: Gated users receive no conversation metadata
3. **Consistent error codes**: PROFILE_INCOMPLETE error code for all gating
4. **Zero trust**: Client-side checks complement but don't replace server checks

## Telemetry & Monitoring

### Recommended Logging Events:
- `messages_gated_view`: When onboarding notice is shown
- `messages_gated_api_access`: When gated user attempts API access
- `messages_unlocked`: When user crosses 80% threshold and accesses messages

### Analytics Metrics:
- Track conversion rate from gated to unlocked
- Monitor time to 80% completion
- Track profile completion journey

No new environment variables required.

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert the following commits:
1. Backend gating logic in routes/conversations.js
2. Backend gating in routes/messages.js
3. Frontend gating UI in pages/Conversations/
4. Middleware threshold change in middleware/profileCompletion.js

## Related Documentation

- Original task context in issue description
- Profile completion logic: `backend/middleware/profileCompletion.js`
- Business model completion calculation: `backend/models/Business.js`
- System HTML constants: `frontend/src/constants/systemHtml.js`

## Known Limitations

1. Profile completion percentage cache: If user updates profile, they may need to refresh the page to see unlocked messaging (handled by react-query refetch intervals)
2. Real-time unlock: Currently requires page navigation or reload after crossing threshold
3. Feature flags: No feature flag system in place for gradual rollout

## Future Enhancements

1. Add telemetry events for analytics
2. Implement progress notifications when user approaches 80%
3. Add A/B testing for threshold value
4. Create admin dashboard for monitoring gating effectiveness
5. Add in-app tutorial for profile completion
