# Admin Dashboard Backend Update Summary

## Date: 2025-09-08

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Active VAs Calculation
- **Location**: `/Users/harrymurphy/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Coding Projects/Linkage VA Hub MERN Stack/backend/routes/admin.js`
- **Endpoints Updated**: 
  - `GET /api/admin/stats`
  - `GET /api/admin/dashboard`

#### Previous Implementation:
- Active VAs were calculated based on their `searchStatus` field being either 'actively_looking' or 'open'

#### New Implementation:
- Active VAs are now calculated as VAs whose associated User account has a `stats.lastActive` date within the last 30 days
- Uses MongoDB aggregation pipeline to join VA collection with User collection
- Checks the `userInfo.stats.lastActive` field against a 30-day threshold

### 2. Removed Pending Approvals
- **What was removed**: 
  - The `pendingApprovals` field from both `/stats` and `/dashboard` endpoints
  - These were already set to return 0 with comments indicating "No pending approvals since we removed pending status"
- **Current state**: 
  - The fields are commented out in the response objects
  - No pending approvals data is tracked or returned

### 3. Technical Implementation Details

#### Active VAs Calculation Query:
```javascript
VA.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: 'users',
      localField: 'user',
      foreignField: '_id',
      as: 'userInfo'
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: '$userInfo'
  },
  {
    $match: {
      'userInfo.stats.lastActive': { $gte: thirtyDaysAgo }
    }
  },
  {
    $count: 'total'
  }
])
```

### 4. Testing
- Created test script: `test-admin-dashboard.js`
- Verifies the Active VAs calculation logic
- Shows sample VA activity status
- Provides summary statistics

### 5. Impact on Frontend
The admin dashboard frontend will need to:
1. Handle the new `activeVAs` field in the `/dashboard` endpoint response
2. Remove any UI elements related to "Pending Approvals" if they exist
3. Update any labels to clarify that "Active VAs" means "VAs who logged in within the last 30 days"

### 6. Benefits
- **More accurate metrics**: Active VAs now reflects actual user engagement rather than profile status
- **Better insights**: Admins can see which VAs are actively using the platform
- **Cleaner codebase**: Removed unused pending approvals logic

### 7. Files Modified
1. `/backend/routes/admin.js` - Main changes to dashboard endpoints
2. `/backend/test-admin-dashboard.js` - New test script (can be deleted after verification)

### 8. Next Steps
1. Update the admin frontend to handle the new data structure
2. Update any documentation or tooltips to explain the new "Active VAs" metric
3. Consider adding additional time-based filters (7 days, 60 days, etc.) if needed
4. Monitor the performance of the aggregation queries on larger datasets

## Notes
- The `stats.lastActive` field in the User model is automatically updated when users log in or perform actions
- The 30-day threshold is hardcoded but could be made configurable through environment variables or admin settings if needed
- The aggregation pipeline is efficient but may need indexing on `user.stats.lastActive` for optimal performance with large datasets
