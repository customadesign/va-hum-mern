# ðŸš¨ Emergency Fix - Server 500 Error

The server is returning 500 errors because it's trying to use Supabase without credentials.

## Quick Fix Option 1: Add Supabase Credentials NOW

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on `linkage-va-hub-api` service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add these variables:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   SUPABASE_BUCKET=linkage-va-hub
   ```
5. Click **Save Changes** - this will trigger a redeploy

## Quick Fix Option 2: Revert to Local Storage Temporarily

If you don't have Supabase credentials ready, push this quick fix:

```bash
# Revert the route changes
git checkout backend/routes/vas.js
git add backend/routes/vas.js
git commit -m "Revert: Temporarily disable Supabase until credentials are added"
git push
```

This will make uploads fail with a cleaner error instead of crashing the server.

## What's Happening?

The code is checking for Supabase credentials and trying to use them, but since they're not set in Render, it's causing the server to crash when handling uploads. The `/api/vas/me` endpoint is also failing because the server is in an error state.

## Permanent Solution

You need to:
1. Create a Supabase account (free): https://app.supabase.com
2. Create a new project
3. Go to Settings â†’ API to get your credentials
4. Add them to Render as shown above

Without Supabase credentials, file uploads cannot work on Render's serverless platform.
