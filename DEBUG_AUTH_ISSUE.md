# Debugging Authentication Issue in Linkage VA Hub Admin

## Problem
The admin frontend deployed at https://admin-3pxa.onrender.com/login was experiencing an authentication issue where users would log in successfully but then be immediately logged out and redirected back to the login page.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a combination of factors:

1. **Race Condition in Authentication Checks**: The `AuthContext` was performing authentication checks without proper safeguards against concurrent checks, which could lead to conflicting state updates.

2. **Error Handling for Network Issues**: The authentication system was clearing user credentials on any error, including temporary network issues, which could cause unintended logouts.

3. **Cross-Origin Cookie Handling**: When deployed across different domains (admin-3pxa.onrender.com and linkage-va-hub-api.onrender.com), the browser's SameSite cookie policy was preventing cookies from being properly maintained.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Authentication Flow
- Added reference flags to prevent concurrent authentication checks
- Added a flag to track initialization state to prevent redundant checks
- Improved error handling to only clear authentication on actual auth errors (401/403), not on network issues

```javascript
// Added reference flags
const isCheckingAuth = useRef(false);
const hasInitialized = useRef(false);

// Prevent multiple simultaneous auth checks
if (hasInitialized.current) return;
hasInitialized.current = true;

// Prevent concurrent auth checks
if (isCheckingAuth.current) return;
isCheckingAuth.current = true;
```

### 2. Better Error Handling
- Modified error handling to distinguish between authentication errors and network errors
- Preserved authentication state during temporary network issues

```javascript
// Only clear auth if it's a 401 or 403 error
if (error.response?.status === 401 || error.response?.status === 403) {
  localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
  delete axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'];
  setUser(null);
  setIsAuthenticated(false);
} else {
  // For other errors (network, etc), keep the existing auth state
  // This prevents logout on temporary network issues
  console.log('Keeping existing auth state due to non-auth error');
}
```

### 3. Improved CORS and Proxy Configuration
- Updated the `_redirects` file to properly handle API requests
- Added proxy configuration to route API requests through the same domain to avoid CORS issues

```
/*    /index.html   200
/* /index.html 200
/api/* https://linkage-va-hub-api.onrender.com/api/:splat 200
```

## Verification
After implementing these changes, the authentication flow should work correctly:
1. User logs in with valid credentials
2. Authentication state is properly maintained
3. User remains logged in until explicitly logging out or the token expires

## Additional Recommendations
1. **Token Refresh Mechanism**: Implement a token refresh mechanism to automatically renew tokens before they expire
2. **Persistent Login**: Consider adding a "Remember Me" option for longer sessions
3. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring to track authentication failures and identify patterns
4. **Error Feedback**: Improve error messages to users when authentication issues occur
